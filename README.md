## Quick Start

Currently there is no Nuget package available, but it is planned.

To get started with Blazor CodeMirror 6:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gaelj/BlazorCodeMirror6.git`
- Reference in your project: `<ProjectReference Include="..\CodeMirror6\CodeMirror6.csproj" />`
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npx: `npm install npx`
- Add `@using CodeMirror6` in your `_Imports.razor` or page/component.
- Use the `<CodeMirror6Wrapper />` component as demonstrated in `Examples.Common/Example.razor`.
- For build issues: `run dotnet clean` followed by `dotnet build`.

## Examples

See `Examples.Common/Example.razor`

JS / CSS resources are loaded automatically (nothing to add in `_Host.cshtml` / `index.html`).

Just add `@using CodeMirror6` in `_Imports.razor` or in your razor page / component and use `<CodeMirror6Wrapper />` as in the examples.

## Modification

- The javascript-side initialization is in `CodeMirror6/NodeLib/src/index.ts`
- Interop from .Net to JS is in `CodeMirror6/CodeMirrorJsInterop.cs`
- Interop from JS to .Net is in `CodeMirror6Wrapper.razor.cs`
- The blazor component is in `CodeMirror6Wrapper.razor` and `CodeMirror6Wrapper.razor.cs`
- The example component is in `Examples.Common/Example.razor`

> The Node project is automatically built with the .Net project.

## FAQs / Troubleshooting

- If you have npm / rollup errors when building (for example after pulling recent changes), `dotnet clean` will delete the `node_modules` directory. Then run `dotnet build` again.
